To copy curl request, go to kibana create your visualization and run it. Click inspect element and go to Network section. In the network section check for file called "_msearch" click on it and copy it as CURL request.

Step 2 : Create a shell script file by refering file main.sh 

Main File 
Line 2,3,4 : Gets the time this time is then passed to curl request.
Line 5 : Creates a variable which coantains the modified curl request with time and escaping characters. 
Line 6,7 : The output of this filw will be written to another shell script file called "out.sh". Out.sh will conatin your final modified CURL request.
Line 8 : Executes this out.sh file and and will generate out.json file. The json file will contain the response data. 
Line 9 : nodejs script "alert.js" will read the JSON response file and send alerts accroding to your conditions specified in the script. 

Note that you can have any condition, you are not restricted to any particular condition like in case of elast alert.
